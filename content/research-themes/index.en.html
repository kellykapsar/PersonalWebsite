<div id="telecoupled-human-and-natural-systems" class="section level3">
<h3>Telecoupled human and natural systems</h3>
<p>In an increasingly globalized world, very few places are truly isolated. Global markets, geopolitical tension, foreign investment, migration, climate change. All of these processes</p>
</div>
<div id="human-wildlife-coexistence" class="section level3">
<h3>Human-wildlife coexistence</h3>
<p>I am passionate about working towards a planet where humans can coexist with sustainable populations of wildlife. One way to promote this coexistence is to look at places where humans and wildlife overlap. By examining the nature of interactions between humans and wildlife (e.g., competition, conflict), we can learn which human activities promote or deter coexistence. In particular, I am interested in the role that scale in these processes. For instance, a predator species may have a high degree of spatial overlap with humans, but only travel into human-inhabited areas at night when human activities are limited.</p>

<div id="community-engagement" class="section level3">
<h3>Community engagement</h3>
<p>Human communities living alongside wildlife are often the most affected by conservation actions and also often left out of the conservation decision-making process. At the same time, community members are commonly in the best position to evaluate on-the-ground changes to the environment and wildlife populations. Meaningful engagement with communities is a process that takes time.</p>
